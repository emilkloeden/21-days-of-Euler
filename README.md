# 21-days-of-Euler
A self-derived, self-inflicted coding challenge/journey in which participants will endeavour to complete 10 [project euler](https://projecteuler.net/show=all) problems in 21 days.

## The Rules:
1. You can solve problems you have already solved *in a different language.*
2. Submissions/commits are to be made on regular 2-day intervals. 1 problem per submission.
3. All problem/language combinations must be submitted on day 1.
4. You can research solutions to the problem but avoid solutions posted in the same language
5. You can re-use method/function definitions or libraries previously written


## My list:

| Day | Date | Problem | Language | Solved |
| --- | ---- | ------- | -------- | ------ |
| 3   | 11-2-2015 | 1 | Ruby | 10-2-2015 |
